This project was developed using a combination of modern technologies and frameworks. The front-end is built with `<strong>`Vue.js `</strong>`,providing a dynamic and responsive user interface. On the server side, `<strong>`Flask `</strong>`, a lightweight WSGI web application framework written in `<strong>`Python `</strong>`, is used to handle requests and serve data. Data persistence is achieved through `<strong>`SQLite `</strong>`, a self-contained, high-reliability, embedded, full-featured, public-domain, SQL database engine.
