# Description

This project was developed using a combination of modern technologies and frameworks. The front-end is built with <strong> Vue.js </strong>,providing a dynamic and responsive user interface. On the server side, <strong>Flask </strong>, a lightweight web application framework written in <strong> Python</strong>, is used to handle requests and serve data. Data persistence is achieved through <strong> SQLite </strong>, a self-contained, high-reliability, embedded, full-featured, public-domain, SQL database engine.

# Front-end Project

The Front-end Project is a comprehensive system for managing company data, including employees, departments, and academic degrees. It consists of an HTML template for structure, a JavaScript script for future logic, and CSS styles for aesthetics and responsiveness. Users can view, filter, and manage data through interfaces with modals for adding, editing, and deleting records. The system uses axios for server communication and CSS for styling. To set up the project, clone the repository, install dependencies, and run the development server.

## Home Page

The Company Employee Database Management System consists of three main sections: the HTML template, the JavaScript script, and the CSS styles. The HTML template includes a welcome message for system users, displayed on the HomePage tab. The JavaScript script is currently empty but may contain application logic in the future, managing user interactions and communication with the database. The CSS styling includes importing the Poppins font from Google Fonts, styling the main container of the application, aligning and styling the welcome message, as well as styling the navigation and navigation links. The styling ensures an aesthetic appearance and responsiveness of the application.
